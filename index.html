    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <br>
    <pre>Code:

        JavaScript
        var x = 9;
        if (true) {
          var x = 6;
          console.log(x); // Output: 6
        }
        console.log("here: ", x); // Output: undefined
        Use code with caution.

        Explanation:
        
        Variable Declaration:
        
        var x = 9; declares a variable named x with the initial value 9. Due to using var, the scope of this variable is the entire script (global scope).
        if Statement:
        
        if (true): Since true is always true, the code block within the if statement will always execute.
        Inside the if block:
        var x = 6;: This line again declares a variable named x and assigns it the value 6. However, because var has function scope (or global scope if outside a function), this declaration shadows the previously declared x within the scope of the if block. So, within the if block, x refers to the value 6.
        console.log(x); // Output: 6: This line prints the value of x inside the if block, which is 6 due to the shadowing effect.
        Second console.log:
        
        console.log("here: ", x); // Output: undefined: This line attempts to print the value of x outside the if block. However, the original x declared with 9 is no longer accessible here because it was shadowed by the var x = 6; inside the if block.
        Since there's no other declaration of x outside the if block, and var variables are not automatically initialized to undefined, the value of x remains undefined when accessed here. This results in the output "undefined" being printed.
        Key Points:
        
        Shadowing: var can lead to shadowing of variables with the same name within nested scopes, potentially causing confusion.
        Scope: var has function scope or global scope, depending on where it's declared.
        Best Practices: In modern JavaScript, it's recommended to use let or const for variable declarations to avoid shadowing and promote better code organization.
        Corrected Code Using let:
        
        JavaScript
        let x = 9; // `let` has block scope
        if (true) {
          let x = 6; // This declaration is local to the if block
          console.log(x); // Output: 6
        }
        console.log("here: ", x); // Output: 9 (original value)
        Use code with caution.
        content_copy
        In this corrected code using let, the x declared inside the if block is local to that block, preventing shadowing and preserving the original value 9 for the outer console.log.</pre>
